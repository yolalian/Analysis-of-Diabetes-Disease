# Analysis-of-Diabetes-Disease

This project analyzes a diabetes dataset containing features such as Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age, and Outcome. The dataset helps us understand various factors contributing to diabetes.

We will explore the age distribution among diabetic and non-diabetic patients, investigate whether patients with a higher number of pregnancies have a higher risk of diabetes, and examine if patients with a higher Body Mass Index (BMI) have a higher risk of diabetes.

The dataset can be downloaded from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset).
